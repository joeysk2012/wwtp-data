Mobile responsiveness
	-Please move the graphs below the map when viewing in mobile.  Make sure    everything is viewable and not squished including the labels when you click the charts.
-Please fix text box from cutting off when you click a icon in mobile

 


2. Website speed

Please decrease the load time fo the the website to make my site load faster. See what you can do to improve the Pagespeed score to good. Currently showing ~11 seconds to load for first time users on pingdom.com can we get it down to around 5? 


3. Site Design

Please update site look more professional by doing the following:

A simple navbar like this,  at the top as an example: 

-Logo not required. But Title it “Wastewater-Data”
-Color should be some kind of blue 
-You can remove big title and “Click on the Map Icons to Display information!”
-Should have an “Instructions” link that opens a modal that explains how to use this site with info graphics. 

-Should a have a “About” link that has mission purpose of the website (again, a  modal is fine):

“This web application maps all of the wastewater treatment plans in California. Water is a topic of importance in California due to the shortage of availability. The purpose of the project is:
-To make aware of the location of wastewater treatment agencies, treatment plant locations and the volume of wastewater collected.
-To help cities and government agencies to better plan for water usage and ensure adequate water supplies are available for current and future demands.
-To ensure wastewater treatment plants are in compliance with federal and state regulations. 
	
There are over 300 plants on the map. Locations and coordinates are taken off of Google maps (http://maps.google.com). The data source of this project is the State of California department of Water Resources 2015 Urban Water Management Plan. See Links for more information.
